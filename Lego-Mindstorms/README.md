# Lego-Minstorms
Back when I started learning robotics, I purchased a few robotics kits that helped me in that journey. The Lego-Mindstorm kit was one of them that I found to be really useful to start out. I am keeping this repo around for archival sake. The code is not maintained.

## Fork Notes
This repo was forked from an alt github account that I intend to delete in the near future.
