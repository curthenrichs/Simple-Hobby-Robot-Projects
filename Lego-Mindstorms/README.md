# Lego-Minstorms
Back when I started learning robotics, I purchased a few robotics kits that helped me in that journey. The Lego-Mindstorm kit was one of them that I found rather fun when starting out. I am keeping this repo around for archival sake. The code is not maintained.

The specific code I am preserving is for a simple humanoid walker that I called  Beta-Rex. Note: the original version Alpha-Rex was provided by Lego, my modifications incremented it by one. It doesn't do anything special, just another wall-banger using an ultrasonic sensor.
