# Spinbot
The goal of spinbot was to develop a single motor robot that would dynamically control its spin in order to "fling" itself toward its light source.

Note, this project was never completed. I did have the hardware complete, a first verison of the firmware, and some Unity simulations that generated control policies (as neural networks). However, these components never came together as I wanted. At some point in the future I may want to revisit this concept.

This codebase is provided for my archival purposes only. The code is not well structured nor maintained.
