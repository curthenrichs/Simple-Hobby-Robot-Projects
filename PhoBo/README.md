# PhoBo
This was an Eagle board layout project where I wanted to use an old phone to
directly control two motors. The goal was to use an op-amp connected to the
phones headphone jack that was wired to produce a + / - delta which in turn
caused a difference in power in the motors.

I finished the first version of the board but never got around to actually
build the robot or write the code.
