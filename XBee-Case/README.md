# XBee Case
Simple case to hold an XBee USB PC PCB that I purchased a while ago. The CAD files
are here in case a new one needs to be printed.

Note that a bit of sanding is needed to get the cover to fit firmly but completely
on the base. The plastic standoffs in the base also need to be updated. They break
really easily so a sturdier design is needed.
